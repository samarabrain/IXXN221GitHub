											<p>In today's lecture, we discussed different features to consider when designing for the web. When carefully considered and applied, the composition of a website can make a significant difference on the user experience. First, we looked at grids, which is the layout of the page and the different features consisting of the margin, columns and gutter spacing. Grids create consistency and can be used to visually separate elements using negative space and help with visual hierarchy. Visual hierarchy is all about guiding the eye on the page in order of importance. Visual hierarchy controls the delivery of the website as it forms the path for users to follow. Visual hierarchy can be implemented through the use of variation in colour, font, scale, placement etc.</p>
                                        <p></ul><li>Colour: creates contrast and can direct the user's attention to specific elements. For example, bright colours grab the user's attention on a dull page.</li>
                                            <br><li>Scale: users notice larger elements first. For example, larger font sizes and heavier font weights will draw user's attention first.</li>
                                            <br><li>White space: more space around elements draws the eye towards them.</li>
                                            <br><li>Balance: equally distributed elements focus the user's attention on the centre of the page</li></p>
                                            <p>We then discussed affordances, the little prompts that indicate to users how to interact with elements. An example is how links are blue and underlined to indicate that users can click on the link and be directed to a different page. User's past experiences and knowledge assist affordances with interacting with websites, such as knowing what symbols mean without needing words. As a designer, it is important to consider how we can implement affordances to remove some of the user mental load when interacting with websites. When implementing affordances, it is important not to assume all users have the same past experience, and therefore, not all affordances will always be effective.</p>

												<h2><a href="#">Assignment 2.2 Introductions</a></h2>
											</header>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<p>The first half of the lesson we began the first part of the lectures about the history of the Internet. I found it interesting to see that the internet is not even that much older than me, in my lifetime it has developed so rapidly to what it is today. It makes me wonder where the internet will be in the next 20 years.</p>
											<p>We did our first workshop in class today where we got split into breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear other peoples ideas and process to building a user persona. The feedback from the tutors helped me get a better understanding of what to consider when making a persona. Particularly the discussion around accessibility, how individuals have access to different things due to circumstances (age, culture, location, job, goals etc) and when designing for a specific group/persona it is important to consider what is accessible to them and how you could help make things more accessible for them. </p>
